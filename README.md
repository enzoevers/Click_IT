# Click_IT

To be able to use the application change the database path on line 32 in MainWindow.xaml.cs. The part that you want to change is from "AttachDbFilename=..." to "...;Integrated Security=True".

This was made in my first half year of the ICT bachelor at Fontys. It was mostly focused on learning how to use a database and classes in C#. Because I wrote this in the second period on the first semester, the code could be improved. I still like how the game functions and the things I learned using xaml, sound, images, database, and email.
